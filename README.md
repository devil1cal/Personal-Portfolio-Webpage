  <p>Hi there, I'm self-taught junior front-end developer. This is my own code, I will change and fix many issues in time. I created this one for certification program on <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org">Free Code Camp</a>. You can see my code on <a href="https://codepen.io/devil1cal/full/rgPNev">Code Pen</a> too. I'm still learning important componants about the language, espacially CSS. I tried to make responsive and compatible for cross-browsers, but still I need to check, fix and add some componants like;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I need to make cross-browser test more frequently </li>
     </ul>
